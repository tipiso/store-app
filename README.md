# beqom Frontend Test

## About the boilerplate

The UI has been already developed. This project uses:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): Redux functional action
- [Alto-ui](https://beqom.github.io/alto/storybook): React UI library

Feel free to adapt those choices to your needs and add or remove dependencies. You are also free to change the project structure, split, refactor or delete the existing code as you like.

The project is based on [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In order to start the project just use `yarn start` or `npm start`.

You can edit this README as much as you like: check items done, add extra items or comments, etc.
